-Data Preprocessing

-What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
    -Target variable for the model is "IS_SUCCESSFUL".
-What variable(s) are the features for your model?
    -"IS_SUCCESSFUL" column features 1s and 0s for yes and no. 
-What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
    -"EIN" and "NAME" are removed from the data since they are not needed. 

-How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model?
    -2 hidden layers and an output layer; 3 layers overall. 
-Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
    No, only reached accuracy of 73% instead of 75% target model performance. 
-What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
    -Used more layers and dropped unnecessary data.
